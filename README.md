# Stock-Market-Prediction-using-RNN

### Stock Data can be obtained by obtaining the key from https://api.tiingo.com/

### Rest of the code is self explanatory

It's a basic model, used to track the stock prices for apple for 30 days in future. The code is reusable for any other stocks as well. Accuracy can be improved by tweeking the no. of days for training the LSTM model, I used 100 previous 100 days of prices to predict the next closing price. Maybe increasing the number might increase/decrease the accuracy
